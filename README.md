# Gaza-

## Some facts.

The ongoing war in Gaza has cast a long, dark shadow over countless lives. Families are torn apart, homes reduced to rubble, and the once vibrant streets now echo with the sounds of despair and destruction. The relentless conflict has forced many to flee, leaving behind everything they once knew and loved. Children, who should be playing and learning, are instead growing up amidst fear and uncertainty. The humanitarian crisis deepens with each passing day, as basic necessities become scarce and hope seems like a distant memory. The pain and suffering are palpable, and the yearning for peace grows ever more desperate. This war, like all wars, leaves behind scars that may never fully heal, reminding us of the profound cost of conflict.
**These numbers are from October 2023 to June 2024, and the destruction, devastation, and death continue**

The first chart reveals that children constitute the largest percentage of the deceased at 42.2%, followed by young adults at 30.1%, adults at 14.9%, and elders at 12.8%. This highlights a significant impact on younger populations, which could have profound social and economic implications. The second chart shows a gender distribution where males represent 60.2% of the deceased, compared to 39.8% females.
The high percentage of children (42.2%) and young adults (30.1%) among the deceased is deeply alarming. These numbers highlight the devastating impact of the conflict on the younger population, and not like they said that they didn't target them.
